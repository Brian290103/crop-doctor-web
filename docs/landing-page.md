## About Crop Doctor

**Title:** A Plant Doctor in Every Farmer's Pocket

**Body:**

Crop Doctor is an intelligent assistant for farmers, delivered through an intuitive mobile app. It empowers farmers to identify and resolve crop issues quickly and effectively. By simply uploading a photo of a crop or describing its symptoms in the app, a farmer can get a reliable diagnosis and a clear action plan.

Our AI follows a systematic approach, just like a real agronomist:

1.  **Diagnosis:** Identifies the crop and disease with a confidence level.
2.  **Treatment:** Provides both organic and chemical treatment options with clear instructions.
3.  **Prevention:** Offers advice on how to prevent future outbreaks.

## How the Mobile App Works

**Title:** Get a Diagnosis in Three Simple Steps

1.  **Provide Information:**
    - **Upload an Image:** A farmer takes a photo of the affected crop using their phone.
    - **Or Describe Symptoms:** If a photo isn't possible, the farmer can describe what they see.

2.  **AI Analysis:**
    - Our AI analyzes the data, identifies the crop, and searches its extensive knowledge base for matching diseases and conditions.

3.  **Receive Your Report:**
    - The farmer receives a detailed report in the app, including:
        - The probable diagnosis.
        - The severity of the issue.
        - Step-by-step treatment plans.
        - Preventative measures for the future.
